This project is a simple Python application that collects real-time weather information for a user-entered city and displays the data in a graphical format. The main goal of this task is to understand how to work with external APIs, process real-time data, and visualize it using Python libraries.

In this project, the user is asked to enter a city name. Using that input, the program connects to the OpenWeatherMap API and retrieves current weather details such as temperature, “feels like” temperature, and humidity. If the city name entered by the user is incorrect or not found, the program displays an error message instead of crashing. This makes the application user-friendly and reliable.

Tools and Libraries Used

The primary programming language used is Python. Python is widely used because of its simple syntax, readability, and strong library support. It is especially popular for data analysis, automation, and visualization tasks.

The Requests library is used to communicate with the OpenWeatherMap API. It allows the program to send an HTTP request to the API URL and receive weather data in JSON format. Requests makes handling web data easy and clean, without requiring complex code.

For visualization, Matplotlib is used. Matplotlib helps convert numerical data into visual charts. In this project, a bar chart is created to represent temperature, feels-like temperature, and humidity. Labels are added on top of each bar to clearly show the values, making the graph easy to understand even for non-technical users.

The weather data itself comes from the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides real-time weather information for cities around the world. An API key is used to authenticate requests and ensure secure access to the data.

Editor and Platform Used

This project can be developed and executed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or PyCharm. VS Code is lightweight and supports Python extensions, while PyCharm is a dedicated Python IDE with advanced debugging features. The program can also be run in Jupyter Notebook for learning and demonstration purposes. The project works on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.

Application Areas

This project has several real-world applications. It can be used as a base for developing weather monitoring applications. Students can use it to learn API integration, data handling, and visualization. It is also useful in data analytics practice, where real-time data visualization is required. Additionally, this project is suitable as a mini project for college students in computer science or related fields.
